There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

The social network’s not dead, but it is laggy, and CatchEmAll is the timesink while you’re waiting for content to load.

Join in and CatchEmAll will serve up interesting people on your mobile device (no, you can’t access it on a PC, you shouldn’t have time for that!). Play their game, learn a bit about them, and, if you’re worthy, you can capture them!

Owning people is tremendous: it will provide you with social opportunities like friends, dates, or jobs. It will provide you with sexy and thought-provoking information, like insight into their personal lives, libel about their friends and co-workers, and pictures of their dogs. And it will provide you with bragging rights and a buffer against <a href=”http://www.tinder.com” alt=”We love you, Tinder, you inspired us!”>trolls</a>. 

CatchEmAll makes sure that the more people want your attention, the harder they have to work to get it. You can meet strangers anywhere, but you’re awesome. And whether you were born awesome, achieved awesome, or had awesomeness thrust upon you, CatchEmAll wants you to enjoy the social web you deserve.

You could call it Facebook: the game; you could call it Pokémon for Tinder; you could call it “Dothraki with Friends,” (you beautiful nerd). As long as it you call it something we’ll love you for it.


## Hey Social Web: you’ve got problems ##
The social web has problems. Interesting or attractive or popular people can’t participate without being punished for being interesting or attractive or popular – that’s not fair. All kinds of people can’t interface with it because meeting new people online is generally a chore – that’s no fun.


## We’ve got you answers ##
CatchEmAll is a social game where you meet new people by figuring them out and capturing them. The more interest they’ve gotten the harder they are to catch – and that goes for you, too. Your captives can communicate with you, lucky them. You’ll see the interesting things going on in their lives - and it will be interesting, because CatchEmAll makes everyone work to get catch to you, and you’ll need to work to catch them.
Don’t worry – it’ll be fun. Crazy fun. We’re on that.
